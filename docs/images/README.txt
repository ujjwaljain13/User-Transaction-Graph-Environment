This directory contains documentation images for the project.

To add a screenshot of the graph visualization:
1. Take a screenshot of the application showing the graph visualization
2. Save it as "graph-visualization.png" in this directory
3. The image will be displayed in the README.md file

Note: The actual image file is not included in the repository to keep it lightweight.
You should take a screenshot of your own instance of the application running.
